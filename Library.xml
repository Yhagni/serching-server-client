        <title>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</title>
        <desc>
            Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who
            force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that
            tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and
            takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
            After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within
            the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a
            killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world,
            only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.
            Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a
            dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to
            prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more
            terrifying than he ever could have imagined.
            Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first
            installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes
            adventures to come.

        <title>The Lord Of The Rings</title>
        <desc>
            In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the
            One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from
            him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by
            chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
            From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the
            Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.
            When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the
            Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and
            destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.
            The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf
            the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a
            tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.

        <title>The Hobbit</title>
        <desc>
            In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms
            and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
            hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
            Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first
            published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the
            wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant
            hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page
            paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and
            includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson.

        <title>The Silmarillion</title>
        <desc>
            A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of
            J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.
            Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and
            posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing.
            The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the
            characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and
            Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within
            them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by
            Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but
            they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband
            in the north of Middle-earth. THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred
            against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all
            their heroism, against the great Enemy.
            This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book,
            which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.

        <title>Crime and punishment</title>
        <desc>
            Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and
            commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting
            for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse
            with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and
            finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer
            the chance of redemption.

        <title>The Idiot</title>
        <desc>
            Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself
            enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure
            Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin’s honesty,
            goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him. In her revision
            of the Garnett translation, Anna Brailovsky has corrected inaccuracies wrought by Garnett’s drastic
            anglicization of the novel, restoring as much as possible the syntactical structure of the original story.

            For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have

        <title>Pan Tadeusz</title>
        <desc>
            An epic tale of country life among the Polish and Lithuanian gentry in 1811-1812, Pan Tadeusz by Adam
            Mickiewicz is perhaps Poland's best-known literary work and has been translated into almost every European
            language. This bilingual edition, with side by side Polish and English, features Kenneth R. Mackenzie's
            celebrated English translation.
            The plot has the typical elements of a romantic, historical novel: a feud between two ancient families, a
            love story crossed by the feud, a mysterious figure who dominates the action, and a number of eccentric
            subordinate characters humorously depicted.
            To Poles of all generations, the life, the scenes, and the characters embody the ideals, sentiments and way
            of life of the whole nation.

        <title>Ogniem i mieczem</title>
        <desc>
            Ogniem i mieczem, the first of the novels that make up the Trilogy, it presents the history of Poland
            during the Chmielnicki Uprising (1648-1654). The writer, trying to evoke patriotic feelings in the readers,
            gave the novel the features of an ancient and chivalrous epic, introduced fairy tales and a clear division
            into heroes representing good and evil. Sienkiewicz attributed an unequivocally negative moral qualification
            to the rebellious Cossacks, portrayed as bloodthirsty barbarians, and presented Poles as courageous
            defenders of the homeland and righteous soldiers who obey the knightly code. Contrary to historical truth,
            the leaders of the fighting parties were also inscribed in the black and white diagram. The main thread that
            binds the plot of the first part of the Trilogy was the writer's turbulent love story of a brave flawless
            knight - Jan Skrzetuski and a beautiful, innocent noblewoman - Helena Kurcewiczówna, who, separated by
            enemies and adversities, go through numerous trials. Freeing the girl by Zagłoba and their wandering in
            disguise, falling into Bohun's hands again ... all these adventures lead to a happy ending in which the
            heroes meet and can stand on a wedding carpet.

        <title>Quo Vadis</title>
        <desc>
            Vinicius, the proud centurion who has fallen deeply in love with a mysterious young woman who disappears the
            night they meet;Ligia, the elusive beauty. Vinicius will not easily win her love, for she is a Christian,
            one of the group of dedicated believers led by the apostle Peter. Christians are rare in pagan, hedonistic
            Rome, and suffer great persecution;
            Petronius, uncle to Vinicius, an elegant, witty courtier who scoffs at love and religion but finds his
            nephew's passion charming; and
            Nero himself, enemy of all Christians, a despotic emperor who plunges Rome deeper and deeper into depravity.
            The decadence of his banquets is staggering; and even worse, his mad laughter is heard echoing in the
            amphitheater as gladiators duel to the death.
            As Nero's appalling plans for the Christians become ever clearer, time appears to be running out for the
            young lovers. Vinicius must come to understand the true meaning of Ligia's religion before it is too late.
